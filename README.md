# texmax

**texmax** stands for **TeX Math AST eXtractor** â€” a lightweight, reusable Go library for parsing LaTeX math expressions into structured Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).

Use it to tokenize and parse LaTeX math strings like `\frac{a^2}{b}` into AST nodes that are easy to inspect, transform, or render.
